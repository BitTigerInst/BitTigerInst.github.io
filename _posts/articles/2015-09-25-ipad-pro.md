Apple entering the stylus market means exciting things for iOS and the hardware running it. There's no question that the **iPad Pro** has the makings of being my dream tablet.

Does that dream become reality in November? Or do I prolong it for the inevitable iPad Air 3 with Apple Pencil support later? Two questions I've been wrestling with how to answer ever since the *"Hey Siri" Special Event*.

Left to my wife that answer would be a firm *"uhh no, we're not spending $1,000 on a stupid iPad."* My decision tree is slightly more nuanced than hers though :wink:. I've waited years for these products and if the iPad Pro + Apple Pencil perform anything like they've been demoed --- goodbye to my iPad Air 2 and set of styli[^styli].
